        Hi, I'm Michelle.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a highly motivated University student with a strong work ethic, team spirit,
        and creative flair seeking professional growth and a career in the Software
        Development industry. I have a focus on Full Stack development, Web Design,
        Mobile Apps, and a desire to apply my relevant experience in these areas.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have collaborated successfully in teams using the Agile development paradigm
        and utilized web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, jQuery, Node.JS,
        PHP, SQL, Apache, Postgres, MariaDB, the Heroku web server platform and third-party
        web services.
    </p>

<p>
    <br>When I am not immersed in my studies and academic projects, I enjoy a variety of
    activities and hobbies which include drawing, sewing, sculpting, 3D modelling, jewelry
    making, time with friends, family & church activities, enjoying the outdoors and gardening. In addition, 
    I occasionally volunteer my time at my local church and the HUSCII Coding Dojo at Expedia.
</p>

<p>
    I would love to hear from you regarding professional opportunities. Please check my
