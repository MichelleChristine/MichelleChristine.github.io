        <p> 
            I am currently working on a Java desktop application as a personal project.
            It is meant to function as a tool for writers who generally work in Word documents
            when they are writing character templates. This tool would provide the user with
            the option to create custom character templates for their stories, and fill them
            out as they would a form /data sheet. The forms will be consistent, and updatable
            (optionally add or remove fields without having to update every individual document)
            and will provide convenient and varied field types such as text, number, color, and
            image.
            <br> I have many other features planned for this project, but I am currently
            working on the back-end implementation of the most basic features.

        <p>
            This project was part of a team effort for a UWT Mobile Apps class I took in Fall Quarter
            2018. I gained exposure to important web technologies and enjoyed putting into practice
            what I had learned from previous classes.
            <br>This Android app serves as a chat/weather tool for those days when you don't want
            to be bothered switching between your weather and messaging app (everyone's had those
            days, right?). It provides a way to search for users by email, first name, last name,
            and username, and request to add them as "connections". With connections added, a user
            can chat with them via individual or group chat. When the user wants to view the
            current weather conditions, they can view it using the location determined by the
            device's GPS, or by various other search options including an interactive map
            selection.

            As an introduction to the Agile software development paradigm, the students of
            TCSS360 split into teams of four and began the process of designing, prototyping,
            programming, and testing a Java application to track expenses of home improvement
            projects.
